            I take the stress out of the writing portion of the college application process. I advise students how to
            harness
            their creativity, convey their uniqueness and express themselves articulately and concisely to reveal the
            most
            accurate, authentic and impactful picture of themselves to the college admissions reader.
          </p>
          <p>
            I coach students through the essay process from beginning to end. This includes brainstorming ideas,
            discussing
            the
            outline and structure of the essay(s), and reviewing each draft, with unlimited feedback. Students write
            their
            own
            essays, in their own voice, and provide the university another dimension of themselves to consider, beyond
            the
            straightforward numbers that rule the rest of the application.

            <p>
              After a long career in speechwriting and executive communications at IBM’s European headquarters in Paris, I
              moved
              to the New York City area and pursued a new path in college counseling.
            </p>
            <p>
              I hold a bachelors degree in English from the University of Virginia, a masters degree in Integrated
              Marketing
              Communications from Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism, and a certificate with
              distinction
              in
              College Counseling from UCLA Extension. My UCLA certificate included a capstone practicum project as a
              writing
              coach
              at the Lycée Français de New York, where I continue to provide writing support to high school students
              applying
              to
              universities around the world, particularly in the United States and the UK.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am an alumna interviewer for Northwestern, a mother of three (two who have already successfully completed
              the
              college application process), and a dual citizen of the U.S. and France.
            </p>
            <p>
              I know that the college application process can be fabulously stressful for the student and the family, and
              I
              enjoy
              allaying that stress by working with students on the most subjective and arguably the most compelling
              portion
              of
              the
              application — the essay — which I believe can truly sway an admissions decision when it is well-written and
              persuasive.
